Jquery plugin to create dynamic weather widget

Author Mohammad Shatnawi on 5/7/2016

This plugin creates nice weather widget.

For initial version it shows real data for hardcoded area (Fairfax, VA).

Next version should be updated to take zip code or city/state as an option.

Download the whole project and start from html/weather-widget-demo.html to see how it is working by one jquery call.

Current weather image is not vailable from the web service, I'll try to figure it out in next version.
